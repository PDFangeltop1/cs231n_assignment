  Compute the loss and gradients for a two layer fully connected neural network.
  The net has an input dimension of D, a hidden layer dimension of H, and
  performs classification over C classes. We use a softmax loss function and L2
  regularization the the weight matrices. The two layer net should use a ReLU
  nonlinearity after the first affine layer.

  The two layer net has the following architecture:

  input - fully connected layer - ReLU - fully connected layer - softmax

  The outputs of the second fully-connected layer are the scores for each
  class.

  Inputs:
  - X: Input data of shape (N, D). Each X[i] is a training sample.
  - model: Dictionary mapping parameter names to arrays of parameter values.
    It should contain the following:
    - W1: First layer weights; has shape (D, H)
    - b1: First layer biases; has shape (H,)
    - W2: Second layer weights; has shape (H, C)
    - b2: Second layer biases; has shape (C,)
  - y: Vector of training labels. y[i] is the label for X[i], and each y[i] is
    an integer in the range 0 <= y[i] < C. This parameter is optional; if it
    is not passed then we only return scores, and if it is passed then we
    instead return the loss and gradients.
  - reg: Regularization strength.

  Returns:
  If y not is passed, return a matrix scores of shape (N, C) where scores[i, c]
  is the score for class c on input X[i].

  If y is passed, instead return a tuple of:
  - loss: Loss (data loss and regularization loss) for this batch of training
    samples.
  - grads: Dictionary mapping parameter names to gradients of those parameters
    with respect to the loss function. This should have the same keys as model.
